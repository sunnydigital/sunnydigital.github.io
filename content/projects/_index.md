    This page is kind of like the living quarters of my current and past projects

## Let's See..

From PC Builds to personal ML Projects, I guess a lot is on my mind, but yet what I *don't mind* is sharing all that I have built, with the hopes that **you**, the reader, take slight of interest in what I have made (am making?)

Enjoy!

    This section of my webpage acts as the living quarters of my current and past projects.

    Made and housed, with creativity and love, of course.

## What's this?

From PC builds to programming, I guess I'm always working on *something*. So here are my projects, to share all that I have built, with the hopes that *you*, the reader, take slight joy and interest in what I have to make.

Enjoy!

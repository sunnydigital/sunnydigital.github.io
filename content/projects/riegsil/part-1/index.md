## Part 1

This post summarizes the first part of the RIEGSIL build.

It starts off from a barebones chassis and enumerates through to fan installation, modifying and installing the motherboard, and finishes on the connecting most I/O and necessary ports.

## Getting started

First, the motherboard was prepared by carefully installing the CPU (the renowned Threadripper 3990X from AMD, allowing up to 64-core 128-thread performance), and 5x M.2 1TB hard drives.

Then, the monoblock (a waterblock for a CPU that also covers the chipsets of the motherboard) was also installed, but not before much careful measuring and cutting of thermal pads.

Finally, 8x 32GB RAM sticks were installed, to provide fast DDR4 speeds for calculations.

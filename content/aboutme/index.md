## 👋 Hi! I'm Sunny

I grew up in a small town with a bustling perhiphery, hosting one side of the busiest bridge in the world.

The below is our *historic* view overlooking New York:

I went to both primary and secondary school in my hometown, where I found an interest in STEM and participated in sports as well as band (where I played the Trumpet 🎺).

Thereafter, I went to NYU where I majored in Business with concentrations in Finance, and Computing & Data Science, with a Minor in Mathematics.

However, I actually started out as an Accounting major, intending for examination as a CPA, but realized that I did not truly love the field as much as I had thought/hoped.

Over my freshman year summer, I studied abroad in Cape Town, South Africa where I worked for a creative consulting company help launch a cosmetics company, and the summer thereafter, I worked for Brookfield, where I helped with low frequency trading using language models.

It was during this time that I fell deeply in love with Data Science and its multidisciplinary nature, realizing the importance of recording a true part fo the world.

I took two years off working odd jobs here and there, from an Analyst at Two Sigma to a consultant at Deloitte. Those roles only reaffirmed my decision that Data Science was for me.

I then returned to classes, working part-time as a Data Scientist at NYU's Medical School, where I processed, pipelined, and used pseudo-temporal methods to analyze genetic data.

The classes that I took, to say excellent would be an understatement. It was really a feeling of eased understanding, the three things of *the real world*, *mathematics*, and *code* symbiotically assisting one another. It was also an exteme mix of the visual and the expressive; as I took classes, learned techniques, and was made to understand technologies that allowed computers to (in a way) *perceive* the world as we do. 

Most of my experiences were definitely challenging, however trepidation and persistence were definitely keys for success.

There is much more out there, and this website is my hope to be able to document all the in-betweens and through-outs for all that I experience!

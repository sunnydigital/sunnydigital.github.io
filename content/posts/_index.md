    This section of my webpage is dedicated to the small thoughts in life.
    
    Sentiments however ephemeral are yet deserving of pen and paper,
    
    because you never know: even the faintest synaptic tension,
    
    can bring about an inferno of change.

## Like Post-its, with images and sometimes fancy graphs

From time to time, I'd like to think we all have thoughts we'd like to remember. 

Personally, it was always a shame in the fleeting nature of such things, sometimes relegated to a quick jot on the notes app in my phone, without context nor exposition. 

Here's to fixing that.

    This is the section of my webpage is dedicated to the small thoughts in life

    Sentiments however trivial and fleeting are yet deserving of pen and paper

    Because you never know, even the faintest spark of thought

    Can bring about an inferno of change

## Like Post-Its, with images and sometimes fancy graphs

From time to time, I'd like to think we all have thoughts we'd like to remember. 

Personally, it was always a shame in the fleeting nature of such things, sometimes relegated to a quick jot on the notes app in my phone, without context nor exposition. 

Here's to fixing that.

## Initial Conception

This build is currently a work-in-progress making used of some parts that used to house RIEGSIL v1

Currently too lazy (and a bit out of practice) to bend the PETG necessary for this build 

In relationship to my last point, I will soon be posting an article relating the statistical concept of degrees of freedom and the linear algebra of *tube bending* STAY TUNED!

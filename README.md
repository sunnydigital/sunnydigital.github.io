# README

This is the website for Sunny Son, [@sunnydigital](https://github.com/sunnydigital), built using Hugo, with much help from the theme PaperMod and [@jessewei](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod) for providing the necessary guide for feature updates to PaperMod to implement a scrolling table of contents and an icon link to social media at the footer of every page.
